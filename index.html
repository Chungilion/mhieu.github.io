			<h2 style="color:DodgerBlue;">HELLO THERE!</h2>
			<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">Here's a quick introduction about myself</p>
			<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">I have a hobby of playing games - anime kind of games - quite often and because of that I cannot really escape MiHoyo's products. It's inevitable</p>

			<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">I have an interest in AI or to be more precise, Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Reinforcement Learning. Recently I've heard about another type that works with Numerical Model but I'll put it asides for now.</p>
			<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">Even though I like all of those pretty crazy stuff, my grades in class are not the best, in fact you can say they're horrible.</p>
			<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">But I'm sure it will be fine since now I know what I need to do</p>

			<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">I sincerely hope we will have a great semester together!</p>
